# Movie Recommendation System

This project implements a movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering techniques. It analyzes user behavior and preferences to suggest movies they might enjoy.

## Overview

The recommendation system employs collaborative filtering algorithms, including user-based and item-based approaches. It leverages user ratings and movie features to generate personalized recommendations.

## Features

- Recommends movies based on user preferences
- Supports user-based and item-based collaborative filtering
- Handles large datasets efficiently
- Provides an intuitive user interface for exploring recommendations

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Flask (for web application)
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript (for front-end)

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the Flask web application: `python app.py`
3. Enter user preferences and get movie recommendations

## Dataset

The system uses the MovieLens dataset, which contains movie ratings and metadata. The dataset is preprocessed and used to train the recommendation algorithms.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to submit issues or pull requests to improve the system's functionality, performance, or user interface.
